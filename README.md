Primary Music
====================

This page is intended to help LDS Primary music leaders select music for their Primary meetings. Choose a date (defaults to "Next Sunday"), then tab through the song fields, typing a word or number and picking songs from the pop-up, and submit the form. Then print the results or copy-paste them in an email to your accompanists. You can enter as many or as few songs in the Sharing Time section as you like.

## Usage
